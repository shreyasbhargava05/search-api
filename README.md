# Serach APIs

This project is implemented API with two endpoint to perform a hybrid search in a table of 1 million records, 
‚Ä¢ Table 1: Magazine Information
    o Fields: id, title, author, publication_date, category, etc.
‚Ä¢ Table 2: Magazine Content
    o Fields: id, magazine_id (foreign key to Magazine Information), content, vector_representation, etc.
Random data is generated and inserted in both the tables via insert script, magazine.sql and magazine_content.sql



## Below are the steps to set up the application :

# Project Overview
This API provides a hybrid search mechanism for a magazine database containing 1 million records. It efficiently combines traditional keyword-based search with vector similarity search, ensuring highly relevant search results.

## Features
‚úÖ Hybrid Search: Combines keyword and vector-based search for enhanced accuracy.
‚úÖ Scalability: Optimized to handle 1 million records efficiently.
‚úÖ Full-Text Search: Enables fast searches in magazine titles, authors, and content.
‚úÖ Vector Search: Uses embeddings to find semantically similar content.
‚úÖ Indexing & Performance: Utilizes indexing techniques for fast retrieval.

## API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint        | Description          |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| GET    | `/api/search`   | Fetch Data by string |
| POST   | `/api/Update`   | Create embadding of content column|



## Database Schema
üìö Table 1: Magazine Information
Stores general magazine details.

|Column Name | Type |	Description |
|id	INT (PK) |	Unique |  magazine identifier |
|title	| TEXT	| Title of the magazine |
|author	| TEXT |	Author of the magazine|
|publication_date|	DATE |	Date of publication|
|category|	TEXT |	Category of the magazine |


üìù Table 2: Magazine Content
Stores magazine content along with vector embeddings for semantic search.

|Column Name |	Type |	Description |
| id	INT (PK) |	Unique | content identifier |
| magazine_id	INT (FK) |	Reference to Magazine Information |
| content |	TEXT	|Full text content of the magazine |
| vector_representation |	VECTOR| 	Embedding representation for search|


## Search Functionality
1Ô∏è‚É£ Keyword-Based Search
Searches in title, author, and content fields.
Uses PostgreSQL Full-Text Search (to_tsvector, phraseto_tsquery, ts_rank) for efficiency.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Vector Search
Uses vector similarity search to find semantically relevant content.
Requires PGVector or another vector search solution in PostgreSQL.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Hybrid Search
Combines both keyword and vector search results.
